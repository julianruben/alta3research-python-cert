This is Julian Ruben who attended the Python Basics training program in the week of 26-April-2021 and my coach is Mr. Chad Feeser. 

The Program I wrote for the certification is covering the following:

1. Meet all the requirements given in the lab exercise # 48.
2. The program is having three functions,
	a. main() that covers the user input of what action to be taken and whether to continue or not
	
	b. findPopulation() that ask user what year to display the population and once the user provide a year from the list, it will display the population for that year and also display the source where the data is from.

	c. createGraph() that uses to generate the pie chart for the data from the API.

For this program I used the API from Data USA https://datausa.io/api/data?drilldowns=Nation&measures=Population

When you run the program, it will first ask you to choose the action to perform. 
	If you choose 1 then you will be asked to choose the year for which the populatin to be displayed. If you choose a year number, it will display the population for that year and also display the source of the data.
	If you choose 2 then you a pie chart will be created and a display message will tell you the success message and the locaito where the file is generated.

System will ask you the option wherher or not to continue, if you choose Y then you will ask again with the action choice, if you choose N then the program will quit.

If you choose any wrong input, the system will diplay the message with next steps.

Thank you for the great coaching you did during the training session. Looking forward for the upcoming training.
